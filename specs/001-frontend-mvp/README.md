   - Technical context (Next.js 16, TypeScript 5, React 19)
   - Constitution compliance validation (5/5 applicable principles)
   - Project structure (domain/application/infrastructure layers)
   - 3-phase execution plan (Research → Design → Implementation)

3. **[checklists/requirements.md](./checklists/requirements.md)** - Quality Validation ✅ PASSED

6. **contracts/** - Phase 1 API Contracts (PENDING)
   - TypeScript interface definitions
   - REST API endpoint contracts
   - Request/response types

7. **quickstart.md** - Phase 1 Setup Guide (PENDING)
   - Installation instructions
   - Development workflow
   - Troubleshooting guide

8. **tasks.md** - Phase 2 Task Breakdown (PENDING)
   - Generated by `/speckit.tasks` command
   - Detailed implementation tasks
   - Dependencies and milestones

## Quick Reference

### User Stories Priority

| Priority | Story | Value |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **P1** | Semantic Document Search | Core MVP - users can search existing docs immediately |
| **P2** | Collection-Filtered Search | Enhanced precision for power users with organized collections |
| **P3** | File/Directory Indexing | Convenience - users can rely on CLI initially |

### Architecture Compliance

| Principle | Status | Implementation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Clean Architecture | ✅ PASS | Three-layer separation (domain/application/infrastructure) |
| SOLID Principles | ✅ PASS | Repository pattern, dependency inversion via interfaces |
| Shared Domain | ✅ PASS | Domain types reference backend contracts |
| Dependency Injection | ✅ PASS | React Context + Zustand = ServiceContainer equivalent |
| Feature Flags | ⚠️ N/A | Not applicable (single-variant frontend) |
| Test Coverage | ✅ PASS | >80% unit/integration, 100% contract, full E2E |

### Success Metrics

- **Search Performance**: < 5s end-to-end (including backend)
- **Indexing Initiation**: < 30s from directory selection to processing start
- **Setup Time**: ≤ 2 minutes from fresh checkout to running app
- **UI Responsiveness**: < 300ms updates after API response
- **Error Handling**: 100% coverage of backend error scenarios
- **Reliability**: Zero unhandled promise rejections

## Current Status

### Completed ✅
- [x] Feature specification with 40 functional requirements
- [x] Specification quality validation (all checks passed)
- [x] Implementation plan with constitution compliance
- [x] Technical context definition
- [x] Project structure design

### Next Steps 📋
- [ ] Phase 0: Research (5 topics identified)
- [ ] Phase 1: Design (data model, API contracts, quickstart guide)
- [ ] Phase 1: Update agent context (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- [ ] Phase 2: Generate task breakdown (`/speckit.tasks`)
- [ ] Implementation: Follow task sequence (Foundation → P1 → P2 → P3 → Polish)

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Product Owners
- Read **spec.md** to understand user value and acceptance criteria
- Review **success metrics** above to track progress

### For Developers
- Start with **plan.md** for technical architecture and implementation sequence
- Refer to **checklists/requirements.md** for quality gates
- Wait for **research.md** to resolve technical patterns before coding
- Follow **tasks.md** (when generated) for detailed implementation steps

### For Reviewers
- Verify against **constitution compliance** table above
- Check implementation matches **project structure** in plan.md
- Validate **success criteria** are measurable in delivered code

- **CLI Reference**: [/docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md](../../docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md)

## Notes

**Architecture Decision**: Hexagonal pattern chosen to match backend Clean Architecture and enable testability. Frontend uses React Context + Zustand for dependency injection (functional equivalent of Rust ServiceContainer pattern).

**MVP Scope**: P3 (indexing) explicitly noted as convenience feature. Users can rely on CLI (`mdx index`) for initial indexing while benefiting from search interface (P1) immediately. This allows faster MVP delivery with complete value.

**Testing Approach**: Constitution requires >80% coverage. Testing strategy documented in plan.md Phase 1. Framework setup (Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright) deferred to implementation phase.
