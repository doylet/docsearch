- **Infrastructure Adapters**: Multiple adapter patterns available
- **Shared Domain Crates**: Comprehensive abstractions ready

## üéØ Phase 4D Implementation Strategy

### Revised Approach
Given the audit results, Phase 4D strategy needs adjustment:

#### **Focus Areas**:
1. **CLI Architecture Review**: Assess and potentially refactor CLI to clean architecture
2. **Service Implementation**: Implement the 4 placeholder services using clean architecture
3. **Integration Patterns**: Establish service-to-service communication
4. **Observability**: Implement monitoring across all services

#### **Priority Order**:
1. **CLI Service Review** (High Priority - User-facing)
2. **BFF Service Implementation** (High Priority - API gateway)
3. **Control Service Implementation** (Medium Priority - Orchestration)
4. **Model Host Service Implementation** (Medium Priority - ML capabilities)
5. **Desktop Application** (Lower Priority - Native UI)

## üîß Technical Implementation Framework

### Shared Crate Usage Strategy
All new services will leverage the existing shared crates:

- **zero-latency-core**: Foundation models and error handling
- **zero-latency-vector**: Vector operations (where needed)
- **zero-latency-search**: Search abstractions (where needed)
- **zero-latency-observability**: Monitoring and health
- **zero-latency-config**: Configuration management

### ServiceContainer Pattern
All services will implement the ServiceContainer pattern for dependency injection:

```rust
// Template for new services
pub struct ServiceContainer {
    config: Arc<Config>,
    health_service: Arc<dyn HealthChecker>,
    // Service-specific dependencies
}

impl ServiceContainer {
    pub async fn new(config: Config) -> Result<Self> {
        // Dependency injection setup
    }
}
```

### Integration Patterns
- **HTTP/REST**: Standard service-to-service communication
- **Health Checks**: Standardized health endpoints
- **Configuration**: Unified configuration management
- **Monitoring**: Consistent metrics and tracing
