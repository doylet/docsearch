# Phase 4D Implementation Plan: Service Extension & Production Expansion

**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/phase-4d-service-extension`  
**Duration:** 4 weeks (August 21 - September 18, 2025)  
**Status:** 🚀 STARTING  

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Extend the proven Phase 4C clean architecture patterns across all services in the Zero-Latency monorepo, implement comprehensive integration testing, and establish production-grade observability for enterprise-scale operations.

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### ✅ Phase 4C Achievements (Baseline)
- **Doc-Indexer Service**: Complete clean architecture implementation
- **5 Shared Domain Crates**: All operational and integrated
- **ServiceContainer**: Dependency injection pattern proven
- **Infrastructure Adapters**: Qdrant, embeddings, memory store working
- **Build Status**: Zero compilation errors, clean codebase

### 📋 Service Inventory

Let me analyze the current workspace structure to identify services that need architectural extension:

#### Services Directory (`services/`)
- **doc-indexer/**: ✅ COMPLETE - Clean architecture implemented
- **bff/**: 🔄 PENDING - Backend for Frontend service
- **control/**: 🔄 PENDING - Control plane service  
- **model-host/**: 🔄 PENDING - Model hosting service

#### Apps Directory (`apps/`)
- **desktop/**: 🔄 PENDING - Desktop application

#### Additional Components
- **CLI**: Currently in `crates/cli/` - may need architecture review
- **Edge Components**: `edge/` directory services
- **API Gateway**: May need creation for service orchestration
