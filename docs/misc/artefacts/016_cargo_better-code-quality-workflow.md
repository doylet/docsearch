# Better Rust workflow

- Editor open with rust-analyzer → red squiggles as-you-type.
- Terminal running cargo watch -x check (or -x clippy).
- Save file → instant type & lint feedback.
- cargo test (or cargo watch -x test) running in another pane for TDD.
- cargo.toml `[alias]` section for common commands.
