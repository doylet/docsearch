### Chunking Strategies Implemented

#### ByHeading Strategy

Primary strategy for technical documentation that chunks at markdown heading boundaries while preserving document structure.

**Benefits:**

- Natural content segmentation following author intent
- Hierarchical context preservation with heading breadcrumbs
- Configurable heading depth limits for granularity control
- Special handling of code blocks and tables as complete units

#### BySize Strategy

Size-based chunking with smart boundary detection for consistent chunk dimensions and configurable overlap.

**Features:**

- Configurable target chunk sizes with min/max bounds
- Intelligent overlap for context continuity
- Sentence and paragraph boundary respect
- Heading context propagation across size-based boundaries

#### Hybrid Strategy

Combines heading-based and size-based approaches for optimal balance between structure preservation and size consistency.

**Approach:**

- Primary segmentation by headings for natural breaks
- Secondary size-based splitting for large sections
- Context preservation across all chunk boundaries
- Quality optimization through post-processing

#### Semantic Strategy

Framework for future AI-based chunking with semantic similarity analysis (currently delegates to Hybrid).

**Foundation:**

- Interface designed for semantic model integration
- Placeholder for embedding-based boundary detection
- Extensible architecture for machine learning enhancements
- Quality metrics framework ready for semantic evaluation

### Quality Framework
