### Transport Validation
```bash
# JSON-RPC endpoints responding correctly:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/jsonrpc \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"service.info","id":1}'
# âœ… Returns: service capabilities and version info

curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/jsonrpc \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"health.check","id":2}' 
# âœ… Returns: comprehensive health status
```
