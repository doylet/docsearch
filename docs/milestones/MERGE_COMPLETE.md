# 🎉 Merge Complete: Zero-Latency Project Integration

## ✅ Successfully Merged Features

### Project Organization & Documentation
- **📁 Structured Documentation**: Created organized `docs/` directory with architecture, implementation, milestones, and services
- **🧪 Centralized Testing**: Established `test/integration/` directory with comprehensive test documentation
- **🧹 Project Cleanup**: Removed legacy files, version archives, and temporary artifacts
- **📋 Professional Structure**: Enhanced README with navigation and fixed markdown formatting
- **📚 Documentation Index**: Comprehensive linking and organization for maintainability

### JSON-RPC 2.0 & MCP Protocol Compliance  
- **🔄 Dual Protocol Support**: REST + JSON-RPC 2.0 with standard error codes and batch processing
- **🛠️ MCP Integration**: `/mcp` endpoint with tools/list and tools/call implementations
- **📡 Multiple Transports**: HTTP REST, JSON-RPC, Server-Sent Events streaming, stdio transport
- **🏗️ Clean Architecture**: Enhanced tool service with separation of concerns
- **✅ Full Compliance**: Integration tests and comprehensive error handling

## 🏛️ Current Project Architecture

### Enhanced doc-indexer Service
The service now supports **4 transport mechanisms**:

1. **HTTP REST API** - Traditional REST endpoints
2. **JSON-RPC 2.0** - Standard JSON-RPC protocol compliance
3. **HTTP Streaming** - Server-Sent Events for real-time updates  
4. **stdio Transport** - Process communication for tool integration
