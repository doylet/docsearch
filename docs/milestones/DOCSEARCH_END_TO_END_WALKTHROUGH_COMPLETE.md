# ‚úÖ JSON response with health metrics

# Search endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/api/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Rust programming", "collection": "zero_latency_docs", "limit": 1}'
# ‚úÖ Structured JSON response with search results and metadata
```

**API Validation Results:**
