let results = runner.run("production_readiness_test").await?;
```

### Health Monitoring Integration
```rust
// Production health checking
let mut health_checker = HealthChecker::new(
    Duration::from_secs(30), // check interval
    Duration::from_secs(5),  // timeout
);

health_checker.add_standard_checks(embedding_service, vector_store);
health_checker.start().await?;
```

### Production Configuration
