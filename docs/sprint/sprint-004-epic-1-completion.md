# Sprint 004 Epic 1 - Document ID Preservation - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

**Epic 1: Document ID Preservation** has been **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**. The issue was **NOT** in document ID handling as initially suspected, but in the search response formatting pipeline.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Document ID Flow ✅ (Working Correctly)
1. **MCP Interface** ✅ - Correctly receives `params.id` from tools/call
2. **JSON-RPC Handler** ✅ - Parses UUID and creates Document with provided ID
3. **Document Service** ✅ - Uses `document.id` correctly in chunks
4. **Vector Storage** ✅ - Stores chunks with correct `document_id` in metadata

### Metadata Loss Issues ❌ (Root Cause Found)
1. **SearchResult Creation** ❌ - VectorSearchStep was ignoring collection/custom metadata
2. **Response Formatting** ❌ - JSON-RPC handler hardcoded empty HashMap for metadata

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced SearchResult Schema
**File:** `crates/zero-latency-search/src/models.rs`
- Added `collection: Option<String>` field to SearchResult
- Added `custom_metadata: HashMap<String, String>` field to SearchResult

### 2. Fixed Vector Search Metadata Preservation  
**File:** `crates/zero-latency-search/src/pipeline/vector_search.rs`
- Modified SearchResult creation to preserve collection from VectorMetadata
- Added custom_metadata extraction from vector result metadata

### 3. Fixed JSON-RPC Response Handler
**File:** `services/doc-indexer/src/infrastructure/jsonrpc/handlers.rs`
- Replaced hardcoded empty HashMap with actual result metadata
- Added collection field to response metadata
- Merged custom_metadata into response

## Validation Results

### Test Document Indexing ✅
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "document_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "message": "Document indexed successfully", 
    "success": true
  }
}
```

### Search Response Validation ✅
```json
{
  "id": "f33e76fe-a488-4093-9e3e-55a822963ba0",
  "metadata": {
    "chunk_index": "0",
    "collection": "zero_latency_docs",
    "parent_document_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  },
  "title": "Metadata Fix Test Document"
}
```

## Key Discoveries

1. **Document ID preservation was already working** - The original diagnosis was incorrect
2. **Search response formatting was the bottleneck** - Not the indexing pipeline
3. **Metadata exists but wasn't exposed** - VectorMetadata had all the data
4. **Collection management is functional** - Documents properly assigned to collections

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

- ✅ Document IDs preserved from MCP request through search response
- ✅ Collection information now visible in search results  
- ✅ Basic metadata (chunk_index, parent_document_id) now included
- ✅ System validation successful with test document
- ✅ No regression issues introduced

## Next Steps

**Epic 2: Enhanced Custom Metadata Serialization** - While basic metadata is now working, custom metadata fields (category, priority, author) provided during indexing need investigation to ensure full preservation in search responses.
