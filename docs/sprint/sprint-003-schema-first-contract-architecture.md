# Sprint Plan: Schema-First Contract Architecture Implementation

**Sprint ID:** ZL-003  
**Sprint Name:** Schema-First Contract Architecture Implementation  
**Start Date:** August 29, 2025  
**End Date:** September 12, 2025  
**Duration:** 15 days (3 weeks)  
**Sprint Goal:** Transition from manual contract management to automated schema-first architecture with multi-protocol support  
**Current Status:** IN PROGRESS - Foundation Phase (15% Complete)  
**Related:** [ADR-041](../adr/041_schema-first-contract-architecture.md), [ADR-042](../adr/042_search-service-collection-filtering-resolution.md), [Artefact 052](../misc/artefacts/052_schema-first-contract-architecture-recommendation.md)

## üéØ Sprint Objective

Transform the Zero-Latency system from manual contract constants to a comprehensive schema-first architecture that auto-generates types, clients, and protocol adapters from a central OpenAPI specification. Establish foundation for multi-service and multi-tenant capabilities.

**CRITICAL VALIDATION**: Real-world schema divergence between CLI and REST API discovered during investigation, confirming urgent need for schema-first approach. CLI was sending non-compliant requests due to manual contract management drift.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Comprehensive OpenAPI 3.1 specification covering all current endpoints
- [ ] Automated code generation pipeline producing compilable Rust types
- [ ] REST and JSON-RPC protocol adapters functional with generated types
- [ ] CI/CD integration with schema validation and breaking change detection
- [ ] Zero manual endpoint definitions remaining in codebase
- [ ] Multi-tenant schema patterns established for future services
- [ ] Generated client SDKs for TypeScript and Python
- [ ] Auto-generated API documentation available
