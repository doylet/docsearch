## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Objective

Transform the Zero-Latency system from manual contract constants to a comprehensive schema-first architecture that auto-generates types, clients, and protocol adapters from a central OpenAPI specification. Establish foundation for multi-service and multi-tenant capabilities.

**CRITICAL VALIDATION**: Real-world schema divergence between CLI and REST API discovered during investigation, confirming urgent need for schema-first approach. CLI was sending non-compliant requests due to manual contract management drift.

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Comprehensive OpenAPI 3.1 specification covering all current endpoints
- [x] Automated code generation pipeline producing compilable Rust types
- [x] REST and JSON-RPC protocol adapters functional with generated types
- [x] CI/CD integration with schema validation and breaking change detection
- [x] Zero manual endpoint definitions remaining in codebase
- [x] Multi-tenant schema patterns established for future services
- [x] Generated client SDKs for TypeScript and Python
- [x] Auto-generated API documentation available
